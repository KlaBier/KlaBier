Hello, I am Klaus,

### what I do here?
🔭 I’m currently working on Identity and Security focused on Microsoft Technology

### Is there more?
Yes! When time allows I spend it with 📝 writing articles in the German paper press or I put some content (from my daily experiences) here in my tech blog. But I do much more, check my Blog "About".

💬 Ask me about Active Directory, AAD and On-Premises. Zero Trust and Hybrid Setup (e.g. synchronization)
